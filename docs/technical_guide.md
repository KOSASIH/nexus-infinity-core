### Quantum Entanglement Network (QEN)

The QEN is responsible for managing the entanglement between nodes. It consists of the following components:

* **Node**: A node represents a quantum system that can be entangled with other nodes.
* **Edge**: An edge represents a quantum channel between two nodes.
* **Entanglement Manager**: The entanglement manager is responsible for managing the entanglement between nodes.

### Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)

The QKD is responsible for generating and distributing cryptographic keys between nodes. It consists of the following components:

* **Key Generator**: The key generator is responsible for generating cryptographic keys.
* **Key Distributor**: The key distributor is responsible for distributing the generated keys between nodes.

### Entanglement Swapping (ES)

The ES is responsible for extending entanglement between nodes, enabling secure communication over long distances. It consists of the following components:

* **Entanglement Swapper**: The entanglement swapper is responsible for swapping entanglement between nodes.
