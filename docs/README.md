Nexus Infinity Core
=====================

Welcome to the Nexus Infinity Core, a cutting-edge technology that enables advanced quantum entanglement-based communication and computation. This repository contains the core implementation of the Nexus Infinity system, which includes the Quantum Entanglement Network (QEN), Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), and Entanglement Swapping (ES) capabilities.

Features
--------

* **Quantum Entanglement Network (QEN)**: A scalable and secure network for entangling nodes and distributing quantum keys.
* **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)**: A secure method for generating and distributing cryptographic keys between nodes.
* **Entanglement Swapping (ES)**: A protocol for extending entanglement between nodes, enabling secure communication over long distances.
